# UID-Project-1-my-fictional-CV
For user interface design we had to design a CV and turn it into a 1 page long website. This is a fictitious CV that has been adapted to the assignment, so just to clarify I am not a web designer and I have never followed the training Web Designer syntra - campus Gent.
